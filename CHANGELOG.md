## 0.0.5 - 2024-06-23

* Bump `@savetheclocktower/atom-languageclient` to
  * add support for reporting server-initiated progress messages on async tasks when `busy-signal` is installed;
  * fix bugs relating to the `refactor` service.
* Provide the `refactor` service to allow for renaming of symbols, since Solargraph supports rename requests.
